# scripts/

Build, code generation, CI orchestration and the browser QA harness. `tsconfig.tools.json` typechecks the critical check, build, CI and release entrypoints and their imports; `build-xterm.ts` is also included through `vite.config.ts`. Only the `*.test.ts` files are discovered by a test runner, so the rules that decide whether a check actually runs live in this directory.

## SUITES AND DISCOVERY
- `ci-tests.ts` globs `{src,shared,server,scripts}/**/*.test.ts` and splits the result into exactly two suites with one predicate: a file needs herdr when it ends in `.contract.test.ts`, or it is `server/updater.test.ts`, or it sits under `server/herdr/` or `server/pty/`. Those last three run in the integration suite despite their plain names. A new test that needs a live herdr must take the `.contract.test.ts` name or be added to that predicate; otherwise it lands in the unit suite, where the socket does not exist.
- A `*-regression.ts`, `*-demo-regression.ts` or `*-browser-qa.ts` script is not a test file and nothing discovers it: it runs only from `ci-browser.sh`, from `ui-regression.ts`, or by name. A new one that is not added to one of those never runs in CI.
- Each integration worker gets the herdr session `<session>-<n>`, also when there is only one worker: the plain `<session>` belongs to the browser scripts that run beside the suite in CI.
- The queue is ordered largest file (in bytes) first, so a long file is unlikely to start last and run on alone. Per-file test timeout is raised above Bun's 5 s default because live process and pane probes poll for up to 10 s, and a run that never printed its counts is treated as a failure rather than as an empty pass.

## ISOLATION
- The lock that keeps separate lane and `check run` invocations apart is a listening loopback port (`LOCK_PORT` in `check.ts`) whose holder answers a connection with its pid. Taking it is a single step and it is free again the moment the run is gone however it ended, so there is never a lock left behind to break.
- A run still shares the checkout with the PC: `generate:types --check` is read-only, but the unit suite's generator tests temporarily rewrite the generated file, and `fast` and the browser lane build into `dist/`. Use `check run --build <command...>` when the command serves `dist/`, so the build and command share the lock and report. One run per checkout.
- `bunfig.toml` preloads `test-herdr.ts`, so a test that imports nothing is already pointed at the test session, and `HERDR_TEST_LIVE=1` is the only way back to the user's own herdr.
- macOS keeps its temp dir behind a symlink (`/var` -> `/private/var`) and herdr reports a pane's cwd resolved, so a fixture built under the unresolved path never matches the pane it was made for.
- Verification reports identify source and build state, not just command exit codes. Follow [Checks](../docs/development.md#checks) for report paths, stale-result rules and the build option; do not reuse a report after editing or restacking.

## BROWSER LANE
- The lane builds the demo client once into `HERDR_DEMO_BUILD` and every script copies it (`demo-build.ts`). Run with a directory, `demo-build.ts` always builds into it whatever `HERDR_DEMO_BUILD` says, which is what makes that directory the one the others copy; a script run on its own builds its own.
- `ci-browser.sh` times each script, including the shared demo build, in wall seconds. Its EXIT summary lists every completed script, including a failing one; the first failure still stops the lane, cleanup still runs, and the original exit code is kept.
- Existing checkpoint captures in `sticky-modifiers-regression.ts` and `file-viewer-regression.ts` remain enabled. The `UI_EVIDENCE_DIR` branches in `ui-regression.ts` and `key-bar-customization-demo-regression.ts` add assertions, viewport changes or font waits, so the lane still disables those under `CI` or `CHECK_DIR`.
- `CHECK_BROWSER_EVIDENCE_DIR` separately enables failure capture for explicitly registered fixture pages in `ui-regression.ts` and `prompt-dock-demo-regression.ts`: screenshots, bounded console/page errors and failure metadata. `CHECK_BROWSER_EVIDENCE_TRACE=1` adds traces with screenshots, without DOM snapshots or network recording; traces may still contain action parameters and console events, so use only synthetic fixture data. Capture before closing the failed page, and never replace the original failure with an evidence error. This is not global coverage of every imported browser check.
- `CHROME_PATH` is the lockfile's `playwright-core` Chromium. Only under `CI` are its system libraries installed (`install-deps`, as root through `ci-bounded-retry.sh`, which bounds each apt attempt and tries three times), because a PC is never asked for sudo.
- `ui-regression.ts` runs its checks in one process behind one outer try/finally: the first failure skips every later check (cleanup still runs), and a check that waits without a deadline stops the rest of the suite instead of failing it.

## GENERATED TYPES AND RELEASE GATES
- `generate-protocol-types.ts` emits only the herdr types this repo consumes plus their transitive closure, and widens string enums with `(string & {})`: herdr gives no value-stability guarantee, so a value from a newer herdr has to flow through instead of failing to typecheck. `--check` fails on a stale committed file, `--refresh` re-reads `herdr api schema --json`, and `HERDR_WEB_HERDR_BIN` picks the binary.
- `build-xterm.ts` exists because xterm's source declares `const enum`s in `.d.ts` files, which TypeScript has to inline before Vite sees them. The patch in `patches/` therefore targets xterm's readable source, never its minified `dist`.
- `release-notes.ts` is the gate that runs before a tag is published: it refuses a release whose three version sources disagree, whose notes are empty, or whose `release-summaries.json` entry is missing one of the app's languages. What it prints is the GitHub release body: the English patch-note lists, then the changelog section in a `<details>` fold.
- A remote bundle for another platform fetches that platform's `@lydell/node-pty` package from the registry, because bun installs only the host's prebuild; the pinned tarball digests in `build-remote-bundle.ts` must be updated with the version bump. A win32 bundle is Bun alone and therefore mirrors panes.

## PLUGIN
- herdr's startup hooks are one-shot commands, not supervised daemons, so `plugin.ts` owns the process: `start` detaches the server and records its pid under `HERDR_PLUGIN_STATE_DIR`, and it is idempotent, since a server already answering on the port is left alone. That is what makes one command safe both as a startup hook and as a hand-run action.
- The port is settled before the server is spawned. With no `PORT`, a default that will not open gives way to a far-apart fallback (`plugin-port.ts`), because a port inside a range Windows reserves (Hyper-V, WSL2, Docker) fails although nothing is listening on it; the choice is remembered so the app's address survives a restart.
- A pane entrypoint must follow the active release rather than this checkout (`plugin-runtime.ts`): the plugin checkout outlives an update.

## MEDIA
- `film/` and `readme-media/` record the real client against the browser demo's fixtures at 2x. A take may change what the fixtures say, never how the app behaves.
- Shot times in `film/timeline.ts` are fixed by hand and have to be re-measured after a re-capture, and `film/hand.ts` is a near-copy of `readme-media/record.ts`, so a fix usually belongs in both.
